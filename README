I have been playing with CouchDB lately and was looking for a way to index documents stored in the CouchDB. So, I started an open source project http://code.google.com/p/docusearch/. It includes both POJO based and REST based services for indexing and searching that are hosted in Jetty server. 
== Getting Started ==
To get started download the source using:
{{{
svn checkout http://docusearch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ docusearch-read-only  
}}}
You will need to install Java 1.6, Maven 2.0+ and CouchDB before start using the services. On Mac, you can install CouchDB via:
{{{
sudo port install couchdb
}}}
Then manually start the CouchDB using
{{{
sudo /opt/local/bin/couchdb
}}}

You can verify if CouchDB is running using http://localhost:5984/_utils/index.html.

== Building ==
Type "mvn" to build the project. Maven will download a bunch of files that may take a few minutes and will cache those locally and will then proceed to compile, test and build war file.

== Populating Database ==
You are free to choose your favorite way to add or import data into CouchDB, though the DocuSearch includes some ETL programs to add comma or tab delimited data into CouchDB. For example, let say you want to find authorized e-file providers for IRS, so you download some data from http://www.irs.gov/taxpros/providers/article/0,,id=98168,00.html that has following format:
{{{
business_name,street_address_1,street_address_2,city,state,zip,zip_4,contact_first_name,contact_middle_name,contact_last_name,phone,flag1,flag2,flag3,flag4
}}}
You can import it to the couchdb using
{{{
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.plexobject.docusearch.etl.DocumentLoader" \
								-Dexec.args="efile_providers data/wa.txt none business_name,street_address_1,street_address_2,city,state,zip,zip_4,contact_first_name,contact_middle_name,contact_last_name,phone"
								}}}
								Which takes following arguments:
								
								* name-of-database, e.g. efile_providers
								* name of comma delimited file, e.g. wa.txt
								* id-column or none if database ids will automatically be generated
								* comma-delimited list of fields to be imported
								
								Once the data is loaded, you can create Lucene index, but before that you will have to specify the index policy, which is just another CouchDB document. The index policy specifies fields to be indexed, whether they should be stored in index, score and boost values. These policy configurations are stored in the_config database and you can add the policy using:
								{{{
								curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/the_config/index_policy_for_efile_providers -d \
									'{"_id":"index_policy_for_efile_providers","dbname":"the_config","score":0,"boost":0,"fields":[{"name":"business_name", "storeInIndex":"true"},{"name":"street_address_1"},{"name":"city"},{"name":"zip"},{"name":"contact_first_name"},{"name":"contact_last_name"}]}'
									}}}
									It will return
									{{{
{"ok":true,"id":"index_policy_for_efile_providers","rev":"1-0fd2f5b2e2012f898df677c68daf4592"}
}}}
Note that you will need to pass the "_rev" parameter if you need to update the index policy. Later, you can retrieve the policy using:
{{{
curl http://localhost:5984/the_config/index_policy_for_efile_providers
}}}

Now you are ready to build the index but let's first start the Jetty with the REST based services via
{{{
mvn jetty:run-war
}}}

Now hop on to browser and point to 
{{{
http://localhost:8080
}}}

Finally, you can use curl to build the index via:
{{{
curl -vX POST http://localhost:8080/api/index/primary/efile_providers
}}}

Before you can query, you will have to specify query policy that is also stored in CouchDB and specifies list of fields that are searched, e.g.
{{{
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/the_config/query_policy_for_efile_providers -d \ '{"_id":"query_policy_for_efile_providers","dynamo":"the_config","fields":[{"name":"efile_providers.business_name", "boost":2},{"name":"efile_providers.street_address_1"},{"name":"efile_providers.city"},{"name":"efile_providers.zip"},{"name":"efile_providers.contact_first_name"},{"name":"efile_providers.contact_last_name"}]}'
}}}
Which will return
{{{
{"ok":true,"id":"query_policy_for_efile_providers","rev":"1-618703c1fd66996f23b89c4414dd0842"}
}}}
Again, you will need to pass "_rev" parameter when updating the query policy.  Next you can search contents of the index via:
{{{
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search/efile_providers?keywords=mike"
}}}
Which will return
{{{
{"suggestions":[],"keywords":"mike","start":0,"limit":0,"totalHits":7,"docs":[{"_id":"0352d18145532a05714bfec2e1e649dd","dbname":"efile_providers","indexDate":"20091121","doc":"53","score":"0.0","owner":"*","efile_providers.business_name":"Mr Tax Man"},{"_id":"062d548eb394db3534782c5b6ded0529","dbname":"efile_providers","indexDate":"20091121","doc":"96","score":"0.0","owner":"*","efile_providers.business_name":"Liberty Tax Service"},{"_id":"1ddc6006a2315dd0b0119c0dbc22c1a7","dbname":"efile_providers","indexDate":"20091121","doc":"450","score":"0.0","owner":"*","efile_providers.business_name":"1040 PLUS INC"},{"_id":"3621cc7edde5f191bcc5f3a41160f61e","dbname":"efile_providers","indexDate":"20091121","doc":"793","score":"0.0","owner":"*","efile_providers.business_name":"MIKE A PASSECK CPA"},{"_id":"37a2a152ff120ac293ea67daac1a11aa","dbname":"efile_providers","indexDate":"20091121","doc":"811","score":"0.0","owner":"*","efile_providers.business_name":"Liberty Tax Service"},{"_id":"be0fd60800b9eed6d418601f8cba06f3","dbname":"efile_providers","indexDate":"20091121","doc":"2856","score":"0.0","owner":"*","efile_providers.business_name":"Liberty Tax Service"},{"_id":"dfa948236e87d0c6ba90c612cb166635","dbname":"efile_providers","indexDate":"20091121","doc":"3395","score":"0.0","owner":"*","efile_providers.business_name":"MIKE FOLEYS TAX SERVICE"}]}
}}}
This query functionality can also be tested through a simple html based interface by just pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080/, e.g.
<p>
<img width="640" height="480" src="http://weblog.plexobject.com/images/docusearch_search.png">
<p> 
The index stores id of the document that is indexed so you can also retrieve details of each link using 
{{{
http://localhost:8080/api/storage/efile_providers/0352d18145532a05714bfec2e1e649dd
}}}
This feature can be tested from HTML interface by clicking on details link, e.g.
<p>
<img width="640" height="480" src="http://weblog.plexobject.com/images/docusearch_search_details.png">
<p> 

You can also debug why certain results are showing up using following API
{{{
http://localhost:8080/api/search/explain/efile_providers?keywords=mike
}}}
This feature can be tested from HTML interface by clicking on explain button, e.g.
<p>
<img width="640" height="480" src="http://weblog.plexobject.com/images/docusearch_search_explain.png">
<p> 

Next, you can also find top terms used in the index using:
{{{
http://localhost:8080/api/search/rank/efile_providers?limit=1000
}}}
Again, this feature can be tested from HTML interface by clicking on top terms button, e.g.
<p>
<img width="640" height="480" src="http://weblog.plexobject.com/images/docusearch_search_top.png">
<p> 

You can also find similar searches for a particular search using
{{{
http://localhost:8080/api/search/similar/efile_providers?externalId=37a2a152ff120ac293ea67daac1a11aa&luceneId=811&detailedResults=true
}}}

Which will return
{{{

== Conclusion ==
DocuSearch makes it easy to query documents on CouchDB, however I have also started adding support for Berkley DB if you choose to use it. I found CouchDB wastes a lot of space and is a bit slow so that may be alternative option for some. I also plan to add ngrams and stem based analyzers to create better search experience. I also welcome you to join the project. You can add yourself to http://code.google.com/p/docusearch/ project and start contributing.
